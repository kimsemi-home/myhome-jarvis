# Backlog

## P0

- [x] Enforce no-Python language policy.
  - Linear: offline
  - Acceptance: `go run ./cmd/mhj security check` reports no Python, Node.js, TypeScript, secret, or private-data tracked-file risks.
  - Validation: Go security check.

- [x] Add Go `mhj` CLI skeleton.
  - Linear: offline
  - Acceptance: `version`, `security check`, `command`, `harness home`, `linear status`, `loop once`, and `quality` commands are present.
  - Validation: `go test ./...`

- [x] Add Common Lisp executable SSOT.
  - Linear: offline
  - Acceptance: `sbcl --script lisp/scripts/validate-ssot.lisp` and `sbcl --script lisp/scripts/codegen.lisp` complete deterministically.
  - Validation: generated artifacts match SSOT.

- [x] Add Rust command validation core.
  - Linear: offline
  - Acceptance: `cargo test -p mhj-command` validates YouTube, OTT, volume, display, and unsafe URL cases.
  - Validation: Rust tests.

- [x] Add home-control harness.
  - Linear: offline
  - Acceptance: `go run ./cmd/mhj harness home` passes deterministic dry-run cases.
  - Validation: Go harness command.

## P1

- [x] Add localhost-only Go daemon.
- [x] Add Linear GraphQL client in Go.
- [x] Add closed-loop orchestrator checkpoint evidence.
- [x] Add finance fixture IR in Rust.
  - Validation: `cargo test -p mhj-core finance`
- [x] Add commerce purchase IR in Rust.
  - Validation: `cargo test -p mhj-core commerce`
- [x] Add Parquet+Zstd-ready storage skeleton.
  - Validation: `cargo test -p mhj-core storage`

## P2

- [x] Add Flutter app skeleton after daemon and harness core are stable.
  - Acceptance: `apps/flutter` shows status, command, Linear, and storage tabs without platform runner files, and can load the same snapshot shape from daemon endpoints.
  - Validation: `cd apps/flutter && flutter test && flutter analyze`
- [x] Add benchmark smoke tests.
  - Acceptance: `go run ./cmd/mhj benchmark smoke` runs the core Rust fixture pipeline benchmark smoke test.
  - Validation: `cargo test -p mhj-core benchmark_smoke -- --nocapture`

## P3

- [x] Add fixture-only recommendation scoring skeleton.
  - Acceptance: Rust ranks cash buffer, subscription review, and recurring purchase review recommendations from local fixtures only; Go exposes the recommendation summary through local daemon surfaces; Flutter shows the ranked items in an Optimize tab.
  - Validation: `cargo test -p mhj-core recommendations`; `go test ./internal/domain ./internal/daemon`; `cd apps/flutter && flutter test && flutter analyze`.

- [x] Add fixture-only household view switching.
  - Acceptance: Rust and Go aggregate local finance and commerce fixture data into User, Spouse, and Household scopes; daemon exposes scope summaries; Flutter shows a segmented scope switcher.
  - Validation: `cargo test -p mhj-core household`; `go test ./internal/domain ./internal/daemon`; `cd apps/flutter && flutter test && flutter analyze`.
